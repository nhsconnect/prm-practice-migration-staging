## What is the cut-over?

‘Cutover’ is the period between Final Data Production from the current system and the Go-Live in the new system. 


### During the cut-over

* The new supplier will import the data into the new solution


* **Data entered into the current solution will not be migrated into the new one.** Practices may still enter data but it will not be migrated. Therefore, keep a record of any data entered into the old solution for manual re-entry after Go-Live. 


* It will not be possible to register patients during Cutover.



## Planning for the cut-over

During the ‘Planning for the Cutover’ phase, and **at least 4 weeks before the Final Data Production date,** the practice should gather all the key people who will be involved in the Cutover period to discuss how they will run the activities during this time. 

The objective is to decide what processes to follow during Cutover to ensure the practice runs smoothly and how data re-entry will be approached. This includes any steps that can be taken to minimise the amount of re-entry needed.

The CCG and/or the delivery partner will usually be involved in this meeting and should be able to advise on the best approach.



## General preparation

* [Notify all the 3rd parties (see reference in the 'Kick-off phase)](/prm-practice-migration/guide/kick-off#notification-of-3rd-parties-and-links) and services to switch off links/communications 1-2 days prior to Final Data Production day. As highlighted in the Kick-off and Pre-migration Tasks stages.
 <!-- [UPLIFT] changed location of hyperlink -->
* Make back-ups of any local or third party systems/databases that are not backed up centrally by your current supplier

* Ensure plans are in place for any migration or changes to subsidiary suppliers, for example DocMan or Apollo Scan for document scanning and management
([see information in Pre-migration planning phase](/prm-practice-migration/guide/pre-migration-tasks#subsidiary-suppliers))

* Export any letter templates and clinical templates to Microsoft Word from the current solution so that they can be imported to the new solution at Go-Live. Trainers should be able to assist with this process.

* New registrations cannot be entered during Cutover so the practice should ensure that these are held back for entry post Go-Live and also have a mechanism in place to record activities associated with new patients (eg. consultations or prescription requests, to enable entry after Go-Live).

* Clear down any inboxes and outstanding workflows and all open communication tasks, such as pathology and registration.  On [Final Data Production day](/prm-practice-migration/guide/cutover-and-go-live#final-data-production), there must be zero tasks outstanding.

* Ensure that all users know when to log off the current system so that the supplier can complete the Final Data Extraction



## Best practices and tactics for reducing the cut-over impact


### Appointments:  

* Put breather slots in the rotas on the current system for the first few days post Go-Live. Putting these slots in the rotas on the current system ensures that these can be transferred to the rotas on the new system.

* Building rotas on the test system before the Cutover may be possible, but depends on the solution the practice is migrating to. This could then be exported and then imported into the live system. 

* Limit the advanced rotas on the current solution to no further in advance than two weeks post Go-Live as all booked appointments will need to be manually transferred to the new system on Go-Live day.

* If possible, reschedule data rich chronic disease clinics so that these are not taking place during the cutover period.




### Consultations: 
 
* Carry on as normal entering notes in the current solution and manually transfer these to the new system as part of the data re-entry process once you have gone live. Having Clinicians and staff to re-enter this data helps to reduce re-interpretation of what the data is meant to be.

* It should be possible to copy and paste the free text from the current solution consultations  into the new solution, however coded data will need to be entered manually.

* The practice should have access to the previous system for several weeks post Go-Live, however should this not be the case or you still have data to enter at the end of this period then the practice staff may need to print out the remaining consultations or data from the previous system.



### Home visits:  

* Keep a record of requested visits so that you know which patients have data that need transferring once you are in the Post Go Live phase  



### Telephone calls to patients

* Details of all telephone calls to patients, that result in an entry in the patient record must be noted as these entries will need to be entered in the new system post Go-Live.


* Ensure clinicians keep a record of ad hoc calls to include the name of the patient and the date they were called so that the records can easily be found during data re-entry.


* In order to negate the risk of missed information it is useful to create a rota in the current system, , so that all the calls made can be logged. 


### Prescriptions: 

* Within the Electronic Prescribing System (ePS), repeat dispensing prescriptions are issued individually by the prescribing system and signed and sent individually to Spine as required for the patient. There is a dependency on the prescribing system to retain the information after a migration as it needs to continue generating prescription issues for the authorised period.

  -- Any outstanding repeat dispensing issues held on the Spine for a patient will therefore need to be cancelled and re-issued after Go-Live. This is also a good time to advise the partner pharmacies in your area so they could also prepare for this.
<!-- [GAP] need to add information re: post-dated scripts. Need to investigate how this works on EPS -->

  -- A report can be run within the practice to identify patients likely to be affected, as this will allow any new or remaining issues to be lined up with Cutover. For example, a patient who has a six monthly set of issues could have their last issue of six due in the period covering Cutover, so they will not need a re-issue of these until after Go-Live.
 
* Keep a record of all prescription requests made/issued during the ‘Cutover’ period. Ideally batch all the repeat prescription requests together by date order. If any requests are taken by phone/over the counter/any other method, you will need to make a note of those and add them to the batched information 

* To reduce the amount of effort re-entering prescription data, some practices choose to:  


  -- Issue two prescriptions (either post-dated or by amending the quantity) from the month before the ‘Cutover’ begins until a week after Go-Live. Note: Do not post-date prescriptions sent via Electronic Prescription Service (EPS)


  -- For Electronic Prescription Service (EPS) repeat prescriptions, practices can revert back to issuing FP10 forms from the month before the ‘Cutover’ begins until a week after Go-Live. Changing the option from EPS to FP10 forms needs to happen on an individual patient basis. This can be done at the point of ordering all medications


* With either of these options it is important that patients and pharmacies are informed of this change at the earliest opportunity to avoid any confusion


### Links:

* Recommended cut off periods for Registration and Pathology links will have been advised by  your CCG or delivery partner or the new solution supplier.  The CCG or delivery partner may organise this with the relevant organisations on your behalf, but if not you will need to ensure that you have the correct contact details for this

* Ask the lab to send all results in paper format during Cutover so that your clinicians can review them and take action as appropriate.

* The backlog of pathology results should be sent electronically once you are live on the new solution so you will not need to manually enter these from the paper copies,  but you will need to confirm with your local provider.



### Referrals: 
 
* Print an extra copy of any referrals done during Cutover period and note the UBRN on the printout. These can then be scanned into the new solution post Go-Live. 

* Remember to enter the referral code on the new system if required.


### Scanning:
  
* Everything that comes in during the Cutover period will need to be scanned into the new solution post Go-Live.

* Practices may choose to continue scanning during Cutover to enable easy access to correspondence for clinicians, others may choose not to. 

* In either case, it will be necessary to scan everything into the new solution once live, therefore make sure that all the incoming paper copies are kept together. 



### Screening services:  

* If there are any screening services that send results electronically directly to the clinical system, the service should be asked to stop sending messages from around two days before Cutover starts until after Go-Live.
<!-- [UPLIFT] this section was made more generic so that it could include breast screening, diabetic retinopathy etc -->

### 111 messages/Incoming clinical correspondence:  {#one-one-one-messages}

* Leave all the messages received during the Cutover period in the generic mailbox as they can be picked up from there and dropped into the new solution once you are live.

* You may want to print copies for your GPs to view, or ask them to review in the mailbox, to ensure that anything requiring attention is dealt with.

* 111 messages that are sent directly to the current system should be noted and manually re-entered to the new system post Go-Live.



### Out of hours: {#out-of-hours}  

* The ‘Out of hours’ reports will continue to come into the current solution during Cutover.

* You will need to keep a copy of each for scanning into the new solution once live.



### Summarisation and routine data entry:  {#summarisation}

* Do not do summarisation and routine data entry during the ‘Cutover’ period as the data will not be transferred to the new solution.

For any of the above, you may need to arrange for emergency/urgent activities to be done manually, for example, urgent test results can be posted and the lab notify the practice by phone

## Additional notes:  

* Maintenance support for the old (legacy) system will continue for 3 months post Go-Live and the practice will continue to have access during this period

* Depending on which solution you are migrating to, any patients (other than deceased) deducted before your Final Data Production may not migrate

* We strongly recommend that practices draft in additional support/cover so that there is dedicated people/time for testing and re-entry
