Following your Kick-off meeting, an engineer will need to complete a Technical Survey on site or remotely with the practice.

## What is the Technical Survey?

The survey is to check the current practice setup, focused mainly on the following three areas:

* **Hardware** – All hardware, such as desktop PCs, self check-in screens, call display boards and devices including portable ones should be checked to ensure that they meet the required minimum specification for running the new system. 

   For dispensing practices, barcode scanner and label printer compatibility should also be checked and practices should note that if replacements are required the costs of these may be their responsibility. 

   Consider what new tech might be required as this may be a good time to request new kit from your delivery partner once approved by the CCG. 

* **Network** – this should be checked in-line with the operating requirements of the new system.

* **3rd party application/software compatibility** - Applications that the practice may use that are not part of the current system but may integrate with it, for example, DocMan or Apollo Scan for document scanning and management, DispensIT.

Icons for the new system may have been installed on some devices by the new supplier to enable data checking. The delivery partner may ensure that the icon is installed on all devices before Go-Live, or on Go-Live day, or this may be an activity that the practice is required to complete. If this is the case then the practice should ensure that they have the relevant instructions and are comfortable with carrying this out.



## Who completes this activity?

The Technical Survey may be completed by either:
* The new supplier 
* The delivery partner 

**Make sure you know who will complete this activity.** It might be carried out onsite or remotely.

[As previously noted](/prm-practice-migration/guide/kick-off#technical-survey), it is the responsibility of the practice to ensure that they have contacted their third party software suppliers to check if the software is compatible with the new system and agree any actions required for implementation. The new supplier or delivery partner/CCG may be aware of the compatibility/incompatibility of common 3rd party applications but is not accountable for confirming.

## The outcome of the Technical Survey {#outcome-of-the-technical-survey}

The Technical Survey may result in the identification of replacement or additional hardware being required or the setup of additional third party configurations. Any of these additional requirements should be discussed with and approved by the CCG, in order to align to the intended schedule of the migration.

The practice will be asked to sign off a form for Technical requirements.

Any incompatible equipment may be replaced prior to Go-Live or on Go-Live day. 

This is also a good opportunity to check and update the practice asset register of all hardware so that it is up to date as this will be useful to have on Go-Live.
