The migration will end at the point at which all data has been re-entered, practice staff are trained and are comfortably using the new system. Access to the old system has ended and the new system has been officially signed off by the practice.


## The ‘Post Go-Live period’ {#the-run-off-period}

The ‘Post Go-Live period’ is used to describe the time whereby the practice has access to both the old and new systems. The Post Go-Live period should be agreed with the suppliers. Access to the old system is usually retained for cross referencing data, validation and mapping only.

Practices sometimes require a longer Post Go-Live period and this should be agreed with the CCG as this may incur additional costs.

__Lesson learnt__ - If the process necessary to decommission the current supplier’s system is not implemented at this point, the NHS will continue to pay for the service for longer than needed.
<!-- [GAP] Need to add details regarding 'the document necessary to decommission'-->
<!-- [UPLIFT] Replaced 'document' with 'process' and 'sent' with 'implemented'-->

Arrangements will need to be in place to ensure that current system data and audit trails are accessible and easy to read. Your old supplier will need to provide any necessary support in line with contractual agreements.
<!-- [UPLIFT] added reference to need for audit trails using original format in which data was captured -->
<!-- [GAP] there is no migration of audit trails at this point. We don't yet know how to transfer these -->

<!-- [GAP] we don't know how the M1 milestone payments will be managed within the Buying Catalogue
## Update the Catalogue {#update-the-catalogue}
After the Practice has migrated, the Catalogue should be updated with the date on which deployment occurred.

Not updating the Catalogue with the deployment details can cause issues with payments to the suppliers
{%- endcapture -%}
{%- include inset.html content=lesson_learnt_1 accessibility_text="Lesson learnt" markdown=true -%}
heading will need to read 'update the Catalogue' in any case -->

Steps to do this…
* The new supplier (target) provides a ‘GPSoC-R Deployment Survey Form’ to the practice
* The practice completes the ‘GPSoC-R Deployment Survey Form’
  - The form includes a Go-Live Date. It is essential that the Go-Live Date is entered.
  - The form includes a ‘Deployment Score’ section. This allows the practice to review their satisfaction with the deployment of the system or service
  - The form includes a ‘Comments’ section. This allows the practice detail why they gave the Deployment Score and detail any areas where they feel the supplier could improve their Deployment Service
* Once the survey is complete, the practice sends the Deployment Survey Form to the Clinical Commissioning Group or Commissioning Support Unit (whichever is the assigned Tracking database administrator)
* The above assigned Tracking database administrator updates the Tracking database Schedule A Maintenance screen with the information that the practice has provided -->


## Lessons learned and feedback {#lessons-learned-and-feedback}

We encourage you to hold a ‘lessons learned’ session with all the key people involved. It is a retrospective meeting whereby you look back at the events that took part during the migration and assess the following…

* What worked well?


* What didn’t work so well?


* What would you do differently if you had to migrate again?

Any learnings from this session can be used by the CCG or delivery partner to iterate and improve processes for future migrations.

* * *

## Share your learnings {#share-your-learnings}

Help us improve the guide by sharing your feedback and learnings from your migration so that we can iterate and develope it as well as the overall migration process.
