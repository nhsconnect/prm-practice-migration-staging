During the Cutover phase, you will carry out all the activities planned for in the [Planning for the Cutover phase](/prm-practice-migration/guide/planning-for-cut-over).

## Who is involved
* Practice Staff
* Project Manager
* Lead GP
* CCG / Delivery Partners
* Trainers
* New Supplier


## What to expect during the Cutover {#what-to-expect-during-the-cutover} 

### Final data production 
The Cutover begins when the current supplier produces a final data extraction of the current system. This extract is given to the new supplier who imports the data into the live version of the new system. 

Practice staff will need to be logged off by the time given by the current supplier on Final Data Production day. Practice staff may continue using the current system (solution) knowing that the data entered will not be migrated.


### Manual processes are put in place
[Refer back to the cut-over planning for further details of the processes](/prm-practice-migration/guide/planning-for-cut-over#appointments)

### Configure devices

Depending on which system the practice is migrating to, configuration of devices (eg. scanners, check-in and call waiting boards) may occur pre-Go-Live or on Go-Live day, however these generally cannot be connected to the new system until Go-Live day. This is usually completed by the delivery partner.  <!-- [UPLIFT] added reference to some scenarios, where users can be set up in the Live system prior to Go-Live -->


### Hardware replacement

Incompatible equipment identified in the [Technical Survey](technical-survey) may have been replaced and tested by now, or in some cases this may happen on Go-Live day.


### Activate Smartcards

Depending on the clinical system the practice is migrating to, the solution will be configured for staff, roles and names of sites either before the Go-Live or on Go-Live day. Smart cards will also need to be activated at the appropriate time. Who does this varies between the delivery partner, trainers and practice staff.


### Transfer Booked Appointments

This is the time to enter all future booked appointments that were added to the old system into the new one.

## What to look out for

* Staff availability for Cutover tasks.

* Each practice has its own [MESH](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/message-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-mesh) inbox/queue/secure file transfer. When MESH changes, teams need to inform partner services of the change in address.

* Fixing degraded codes could take the practice some time.
