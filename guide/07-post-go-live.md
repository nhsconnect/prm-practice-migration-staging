By now the practice will have completed the Go-Live steps and the practice staff are now using the new solution. All data entered from now on will be maintained.


## Data re-entry

If you have followed any manual processes during cutover that you established during the [Cutover planning phase](/prm-practice-migration/guide/planning-for-cut-over#appointments), you can now start the task of re-entering the data captured.


{%- capture lesson_learnt_1 -%}
__Lesson learnt__ - Manual entry of the data is a time consuming process and can vary largely due to practice size. Planning for additional resources where possible to assist with this or provide cover whilst this is taking place will reduce the impact on the practice and the time taken to complete this activity.

### Tasks include
<!-- [GAP] once we reach maturity with any of the GP2GP solutions, these can be added here -->
* Printed Prescriptions are manually re-entered 

* Practice re-does any outstanding scripts on the spine for Electronic Prescription Service (EPS) repeat dispensing patients that were cancelled in the pre-migration preparation work

* Pathology results will need to be filed and actioned as appropriate.
<!-- [UPLIFT] updated description of pathology results according to user feedback -->
* Any results that are not normally sent electronically will need to be manually re-entered

* Patient consultations are manually re-entered

* Printed Referrals (urgent referrals) are manually re-entered 



## Registration

Patient registration capability should now be available.


## Online services

Online patient services such as the ability to book appointments online are made available, however, it’s likely that patients will need to be re-registered individually by practice staff as online services patient login details do not transfer between systems. It may be useful to find out which patients frequently used the Online services provided by the previous supplier and prioritise these for re-registration.


## Access to the old solution

The previous system is now read-only. Practices will require access to this, however, for cross referencing data, validation and mapping. If you require an extended access period, this should be agreed with the CCG and the new supplier as this may incur additional costs (and is explained further in the next section of this guide).
